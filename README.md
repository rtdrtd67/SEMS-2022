# SEMS-2022
- C code for finding monotone and hyper-monotone subsequences within random permutation of integers using patience sorting. Wrote to assist in verifying conjectures while in Summer Experience in Mathematical Sciences 2022, studying extensions of the Erdos-Szekeres Theorem.
- C code to simulate a idealized version of the card game war and estimate the expected number of rounds the game will last. Simulated with various strategies such as randomized drawing, always drawing the topmost card, etc.
